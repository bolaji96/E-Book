An Android application for web design tutorials that makes use of the PDFRenderer API. 
It however isn't optimized yet, as I am still learning how to optimize codes to make them run faster and more efficiently. 
The project implements the PDFRenderer perfectly, when I was working on the project, I got stuck a couple of times working with different libraries,
but I found out that Google had their own PDFRenderer API, although it's compatible with devices with API 21 and above. 
It was much easier to work with.
I am open to tips on how to further optimise the project and I hope it would help anyone trying to work with the PDFRenderer API.
